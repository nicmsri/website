Learners can produce a research question that adheres to the FINER and PICOT frameworks\n2. Learners can identify pitfalls associated with four types of questionnaire formats\n3. Learners can clean and summarise different types of questionnaire-generated data\n4. Learners can identify quality criteria for their own data collection tool\n:::\n\n\n## {{< fa list >}} Class Overview\n\n1.  During class we will be using the [files in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BVi27abl-rDbxcK2aJyfz4keflBhW7Fv):  there are [four different]{.highlight-yellow} .csv files for you to work with:\n    a.  `01_binary.csv`\n    b.  `02_likert.csv`\n    c.  `03_multi-choice.csv`\n    d.  `04_text.csv`\n2.  There is also a corresponding [summary]{.highlight-yellow} file (e.g. `01_binary_summary`) with a tab for each group (groups from last week:  wtp, compost, air, coops)\n3.  Your group will\n    a.  Download a data set\n    b.  See what kind of data it is, and develop a corresponding research question (add to summary table)\n    c.  Clean the data (use R, Excel, python, etc:  whatever you like) and note your process and any challenges you faced, and how you addressed them (add to summary table)\n    d.  Analyse the data in a way that answers your research question (add result to summary table)\n4.  We will discuss the pros and cons of each question type\n5.  You will develop your own [questionnaire]{.highlight-yellow} to answer your research question\n\n## {{< fa calendar-days >}} Class schedule\n\nHere is the schedule for May 2:\n\n|           |         |                    |                   |\n|-----------|---------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| **start** | **end** | **Topic**          | **Activity**      |\n| 12:15     | 12:25   | Intro and Welcome  |                   |\n| 12:25     | 12:45   | Research questions | Group discussions |\n| 12:45     | 13:00   | Debugging          |                   |\n| 13:00     | 13:15   | Break              |                   |\n| 13:15     | 14:00   | 4 question types   | Group work        |\n| 14:00     | 14:15   | Break              |                   |\n| 14:15     | 15:00   | Consolidation      |                   |\n\n## {{< fa code >}} Assignments\n\n-   In preparation\n",
