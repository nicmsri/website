## Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Open the GitHub Organisation for the course <https://github.com/rbtl-fs25>

2. Create a new repository and name it: project-USERNAME`. [Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username]{.highlight-yellow}. Avoid using spaces.

## Step 2: Setup folder structure

1. Clone the project-USERNAME repository to Posit Cloud.

2. Open your project-USERNAME repository on Posit Cloud.

3. Create an `R` folder and inside the folder create a new file and save it as `01-data_download.R`.

4. Create another file inside `R` and save it as `02-data_cleaning.R`.

5. Create a `data` folder, and inside the folder create three sub-folders titled `raw`, `processed`, and `final`.

6. Create a `docs` folder inside the root folder.

7. Create a Quarto document inside `docs` and name it `index.qmd`.

8. Add all files to a commit, commit the changes with a meaningful commit message, and push the changes to GitHub.

::: {.callout-note}
## Data download, cleaning, and analysis

You will use the `01-data_download.R` file to download your data from the Google Sheet that you have established for your capstone project. Use the `googlesheets4` package to access the data. Do not clean the data, but save it in the `data/raw` folder using the `write_csv()` function. Give the the a meaningful name that describes your project.

You will use the `02-data_cleaning.R` file to process your data into a state that is ready for analysis. Do not access the data from Google Drive, but rather use the `read_csv()` function to access your data from the `data/raw` folder. Save the processed, analysis-ready data in the `data/processed` folder using the `write_csv()` function. Again, give the file a meaningful name that describes your project.

You will use the `index.qmd` file to write your final report. This will be a Quarto document that will contain your analysis and visualizations. You will need to access the processed data from the `data/processed` folder using the `read_csv()` function. 

You will save the data underlying each displayed summary table and visualization in the `data/final` folder. This requires that each visualization and table is generated from an object that is not further transformed before the code for the visualization or table is written. Use the `write_csv()` function to save the data underlying each visualization and table in the `data/final` folder. Give the files the name of the label you have chosen inside the code-chunk. See example below.

:::

```{r}
#| label: tbl-gapminder-mean
#| tbl-cap: "Mean values of life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by continent"
#| echo: fenced

# load libraries -------------------------------------

library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

# data analysis --------------------------------------

gapminder_mean <- gapminder |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(lifeExp, gdpPercap, pop), 
               names_to = "variable",
               values_to = "value") |> 
  group_by(continent, variable) |> 
  summarise(mean = mean(value),
            n = n()) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, 
              values_from = mean) 

# results display as table ---------------------------
  
gapminder_mean |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)

# save data underlying the table ----------------------

write_csv(here::here("data/final/tbl-gapminder-mean.csv"))

```

## Step 3: Create a `README.md` 

1. Navigate to the Files tab in the bottom right window of RStudio.

2. Open the `data/processed` folder.

3. Click on the "Blank File" button to create a new file.

4. Select the option "Text file".

5. Enter the name "README.md" in field and click OK.

6. Go to: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbtl-dev/metadata-readme-template/main/README.md>

7. Copy the content that's displayed in your browser and paste it into the `README.md` file you have just created.

8. Add all files to a commit, commit the changes with a meaningful commit message, and push the changes to GitHub.


## Step 4: Create a data dictionary

1. Open the following link to a Google Drive folder: <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1MIF7z_nzHPurn719cVulZDWBGMjbFYCo>

2. Open the `capstone-project` folder.

3. Create a new folder and use your GitHub username as the name of the folder.

4. Enter your folder.

5. Create a new spreadsheet and name it `dictionary`.

6. Add two column names to the spreadsheet: `variable_name` and `description`.

::: {.callout-note}
## Data dictionary
This data dictionary will be used for your processed, analysis-ready data in `data/processed`. You will need to describe each variable in your dataset. The `variable_name` column should contain the name of the variable in your dataset, and the `description` column should contain a description of the variable. One sentence per variable without a comma `,`. 

Once you completed your dictionary, you will need to download it as a `.csv` file and add it to your `data/processed` folder in your project-USERNAME repository. You can do that by:

- Using the upload button in the Files tab in RStudio on Posit Cloud.
- Opening the `data/processed` folder on your project-USERNAME repository on GitHub and uploading the file there. If you do this, then you need to pull the changes to your local repository on Posit Cloud.

## Step 5: Submit homework assignment

1. Add all files to the commit, commit the changes with a meaningful commit message, and push the changes to GitHub.
2. Open an issue on GitHub on your project-USERNAME repo and tag the course instructor `@larnsce`.
